      <h2>Where in the region was growth concentrated?</h2>
      
      <p class="bioText"> Between 2000 and 2010, the region's population change was concentrated in the region's core, as well as in in outer counties such as Suffolk in NY, New Haven in CT, and Ocean and Middlesex counties in NJ. Only Essex county saw a decrease in its share of population, while outer regions captured a small percentage of the population growth of the entire region.

      <p class="bioText"> The region's core again captured most of the metro's population increase between 2010 and 2016. During this period, however, the outer counties in the region largely accounted for all population decreases in the region.

       <h2>When did each county experience most growth?</h2>
      <p class="bioText"> The core of the NYC metro region experienced most of its growth after 2010, whereas the outer parts of the region had greater population change between 2000 and 2010.

      <p class="bioText"> Behold, more examples of slope graphs, and what they bring to the slope graph table. 
        In the example below, describing the internet download speeds by country, positive and negative slopes are distinguished by color. 
        Line weight of slopes can be used to call out specific elements, as is used in this case to highlight the (sadly) slow and decreasing download speeds in the United States.
